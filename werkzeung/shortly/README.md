## Structuring
This folder is not a package. This is just a way of structuring where to keep what files. The static page has files that are available to users through Http. The templates are where we will make Jinja look for templates. And the main module will be in root directory.

##shortly.py is our main module.

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].
